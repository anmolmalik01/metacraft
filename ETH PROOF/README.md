# Token Solidity Contract

It is a simple Ethereum token contract that allows minting and burning of tokens.

## Description

The MyToken contract is written in Solidity and provides basic functionality for creating and managing tokens. It allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and assign them to specific addresses. Additionally, it supports burning tokens, reducing the total supply and adjusting the balance of a given address accordingly.

# Getting Started

## Installing

To use the MyToken contract, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the Solidity code from this repository.
2. Save the code to a file named `MyToken.sol` or any preferred name with the `.sol` extension.

## Executing program

To run the MyToken contract, you need to compile and deploy it using a Solidity compiler such as [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/). Follow these steps to execute the program:

1. Open the Solidity compiler Remix.
2. Create a new file or import the `MyToken.sol` file.
3. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
4. Deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network or local blockchain.
5. Interact with the contract by calling the `mint` and `burn` functions, passing the appropriate arguments.
